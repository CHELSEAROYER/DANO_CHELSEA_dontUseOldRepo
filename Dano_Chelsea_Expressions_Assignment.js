//I always watch the clock very closely when I'm at work and calculate how much time is left for fun, so
//for this assignment I wanted to create a calculator that would work that out for me!

var location = prompt ("Are you at work today?");
var time = prompt ("What time is it right now?");
var letsGo = prompt ("When are you scheduled to leave work?);
var timeLeft = letsGo-time;
var result = ("You have"+ timeLeft +"left before it's time to go home!");
