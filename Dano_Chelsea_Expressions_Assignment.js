//Time to take a look at how much money I throw at the takeout industry. Totals of money spent on food within a two week period.

var applebees = 11;
var tacoBell = 4;
var gasStation = 6;
var coffee = 5;
var burgerKing = 9;
var pizzaHut = 15;
var wendys = 8;
var pandaExpress = 11;
var takeOut = [mcdonalds, applebees, tacoBell, gasStation, coffee, burgerKing, pizzaHut, wendys, pandaExpress]
var total = (takeOut[0]+takeOut[2]+takeOut[3]+takeOut[4]+takeOut[5]+takeOut[6]+takeOut[7]+takeout[8])/9;
console.log(total);
//The main idea was to find the sum, and then the average cost of a meal when going out.
